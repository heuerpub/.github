## About us

Heuer Publishing was established in 1928 and today is one of the oldest publishing houses serving the educational and community theatre markets. Heuer is a pioneer in commissioning, publishing, and licensing unique works from a broad range of playwrights, which are entertaining and yet thought-provoking, family appropriate and yet edgy, and which provide a standardized formula for technical production with flexibility for directors desiring a greater challenge. Today, we are building on that same legacy and are blazing a trail in commissioning new works, which you, our customers, have told us are important to you, your actors and audiences. Assisting in this process are the many authors and composers that have agreed to develop new works in these highly focused areas and our newly established Board of Directors, comprised of accomplished teachers and professionals actively involved in all aspects of the Performing Arts and the Humanities.
